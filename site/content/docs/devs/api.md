title: "The API"
---

Note Mark features a REST API for communicating between the frontend and backend. Documentation for the API is automatically generated by the backend and can be accessed by running the app and navigating to certain routes:

- Stoplight interactive docs: `http://{IP:PORT}/api/docs`
- OpenAPI JSON: `http://{IP:PORT}/api/openapi.json`
- OpenAPI YAML: `http://{IP:PORT}/api/openapi.yaml`

This API could be used by a third-party app however, in pre V1 versions the API functionality may change without notice.
