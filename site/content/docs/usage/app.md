## Key Bindings
Depending on the operating system keybindings may be slightly different. On Windows/Linux `<mod>` represents `<ctrl>` and on MacOS it represents `<cmd>`.

### General
- Open note/book search: `<ctrl>k`

### Editor

> To exit the editor via keyboard control you will need to press `<esc><tab>`, due to `<tab>` being bound to indentation.

- Save: `<mod>s`
- Indent: `<mod>]` or `<tab>`
- De-Indent: `<mod>[` or `<shift><tab>`
- Bold: `<mod>b`
- Italic: `<mod>i`
